<h3>Fixing Limitations</h3>
<p>
Projects using Scintilla have run into some limitations of the existing design.
One limitation is that there is only one byte of styling information available 
for each byte of text. Some projects want to associate more styles than are
possible with one byte. This may be because of allowing a complex mix of 
languages in a document such as HTML with embedded client and server-side 
scripts. ASP.NET allows any combination of the (more than 10) .NET languages 
to be used for server side scripts. 
More indicators are wanted by some projects. This can include indicators
of bad code, incorrect indentation and failures to follow coding conventions
with each indicator taking one bit from the style byte. 
</p>
<p>
For some tasks such as displaying large log files, 
the space used by the style buffer is significant so it should be possible to turn 
off the style buffer. 
This could further evolve to allow a callback function to style just those lines 
that are visible.
</p>
<p>
There are several ways to overcome these limitations. One is to widen the styling 
information to be 16 or 32 bits or to be a selectable number of bits. 
Another approach is to allow multiple independent styling buffers with rules defined
to combine these independent styles into graphical attributes. 
For example, there could be
both a basic style buffer using 8 bits to define the lexical class of each character
and a warning style buffer using 3 bits to define different type of warning such as 
invalid code, non portable extensions, and bad indentation and a 1 bit style buffer
for spelling mistakes. 
These could be combined into a 16 bit styling unit and then this could be decoded into 
graphical attributes. As the set of buffers used could vary over time, such as deciding 
to turn on spell checking, the particular bits used for each feature should be 
determined at run time.
The current hard-coded style indices are too inflexible.
</p>
<p>
The current styling interface only really supports single pass styling.
Some users are doing multi-pass styling but this has been difficult because of the
lack of direct support.
An example of this would be to perform an initial lexical styling pass 
to determine the primary appearance of the text and then a second slower 
code analysis pass would look for errors and highlight them with indicators.
</p>
<p>
Some source code consists of a set of languages combined together. Examples include
C++ with embedded SQL, and web pages with both server-side and client-side scripts.
Scintilla uses a large and complex monolithic lexer to process web pages with embedded
scripts. This lexer is dificult to enhance to support another web preprocessor or scripting 
language. A more flexible technique would allow the combination of lexers so that
one lexer is responsible for handling the preprocessor, another for handling HTML, 
and a third for handling client-sde scripts. Adding another client-side scripting language
could then be done by producing or reusing a lexer just for that language.
</p>
<h3>Large Character Sets</h3>
<p>
Text encoded in Unicode and other large character sets could be stored 
in Scintilla using a uniform 2 or 4 bytes per character. This may have space 
and performance benefits over the current scheme which allows variable size 
encodings like UTF-8.
</p>
<h3>Structured API</h3>
<p>
Scintilla is currently a monolithic component exposing a single API
over the whole of its functionality. Exposing more of the internal classes as 
a structured object model means containers can combine those 
classes with more freedom and provide a more natural API.
There is now some support for treating the document as a separate object to 
its views but to perform any operations on the document, it must be selected 
into a view. It should be possible to perform any document operation, such as
changing the text or searching directly on a document even when it is not 
viewed at all. The style settings should be accessible as part of a hierarchy 
so setting a font could be performed as:<br />
<code>styles[C_COMMENT].font = "Geneva"</code><br />
or as:<br />
<code>styles[C_COMMENT] = new Style(styles[C_DEFAULT], "Geneva") </code>
</p>
<p>
Some aspects of Scintilla have been assigned to either the document or the view
depending on where they made the most sense for most projects. It may be useful
to allow style buffers, fold points or markers to be associated with a view rather 
than with the document. It could be made possible for this to be configured
by the container including rules for combining the view and document based data.
An example could be an error checking view which includes extra error indicators 
that would be displayed in addition to the primary clean view.
</p>
<p>
Extending all the built in classes should be supported to allow customisation 
to be accomplished by code injected into the class hierarchy in the natural place
to achieve a task rather than requiring modifications to be located either
on the exterior layer of the component or using the callback mechanism. 
For example, it should be possible to extend the Document class with a locale
sensitive word break method replacing the existing simple word break method.
For this to work, there may need to be a factory class used to create all 
objects rather than allowing the bare use of "new" so that client code can ask
that all requests for "Document" objects be satisfied by returning 
"LocaleSensitiveDocument" objects.
</p>
<h3>Sharing the window</h3>
<p>
Scintilla supports call tips, autocompletion lists and popup menus. Many other types 
of controls could be displayed within the Scintilla window. 
It should be possible for an application to define new controls that share the window
and input events and respond correctly to changes in Scintilla.
It is not enough to just create a window and insert it inside Scintilla as some widgets 
need to watch input characters (such as an autocompletion stealing the arrow keys 
to move its selection) or be sensitive to the user clicking the mouse away from 
the location where the control was created causing the control to disappear.
</p>
<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>
Scintilla has proven to be quite portable to new graphical toolkits starting with
Windows and GTK+ and now extending to wxWindows and Qt. Additional 
portability to emerging toolkits such as GDI+, as discussed on the 
<a href="SWPortability.html">portability page</a>, will allow 
Scintilla to be used in new types of project. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the code in Scintilla, such as the lexical analysis, is useful in contexts
other than GUI applications, such as showing styled text on web pages
or examining code for problems. 
Code should be ignorant that it is communicating 
with a GUI whenever possible so that such code can be reused in other 
applications. 
</p>
<p>
Coding in low level languages such as C++, Java or C# is tedious and error prone
although often required to meet performance objectives.
Higher level languages such as Python and Lua make it easier to write high quality
code but that code may run too slowly for an interactive application. 
It should be possible to achieve the best of both worlds by implementing the
performance bottleneck components in a low level language and then glue them 
together with a high level language. On the managed execution platforms
cross language calling and inheritance is very simple so a combination of languages
can be used.
