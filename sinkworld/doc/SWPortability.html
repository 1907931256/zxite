<h2>Portability</h2>
<p class="update">
There are demonstration GUI front ends for the current code base.
These are source code display applets and there is one version written in Java and
another in C#. The demonstrations are reasonably fast downloads on a cable modem but
may be too slow to use from a dial up line.
</p>
<p class="update">
The <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/nhodgson/SwedeDemo.html">Java
version</a> (35K) uses Swing so needs a browser with a recent
version of Java installed.It has worked in Internet Explorer 6 on Windows 2000, and
Mozilla on both Windows 2000 and Linux.
The <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/">Java Runtime Environment 1.3</a>
was installed to provide a JVM. Use the '+' and '-' keys to zoom in and out on the text. The
'l' key loads a small file from the server and the 'o' key a large file.
May need to click on the applet before the keyboard will work.
</p>
<p class="update">
The <a href="http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/nhodgson/swcset.html">C#
version</a> (45K) uses .NET so needs a recent version of Internet Explorer (tested on 6.0)
with .NET 1.0 installed.
Either the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/000/976/msdncompositedoc.xml">
.NET SDK</a> (140 Meg download, tested)
or the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml">
.NET Framework</a> (22 Meg download)
should work. The '+' and '-' keys work for zooming like the Java version but only when the
control has focus which must be given to it by pressing the tab key until the control's
background is yellow. There is a security restriction in .NET that stops the control from
claiming focus when clicked on. There is a control bar at the top that calls the control.
The first combo box downloads pieces of source from the web site and displays them.
Code fragments can be pasted into the next control, a textarea and then
copied into the source displayer with the Set button.
The TextHintMode is for experimenting with some of the graphics options provided by .NET.
</p><h3>Managed Execution</h3>

<p>
Managed execution platforms such as the Java Virtual Machine and the .NET
Framework have become very important to many developers and are likely
to dominate software development in the future.
</p>
<p>
These platforms enhance safety by allowing components to
interact with a greater (and sometimes scalable) degree of control imposed on
them by the platform.
While this has some benefits for avoiding crashes in stand-alone applications,
it is particularly
beneficial when combining components inside applications such as web browsers.
</p>
<p>
This is of interest to Scintilla in allowing low footprint development environments.
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/Komodo/">Komodo</a> has
demonstrated an IDE built on the framework of a browser but is itself a
heavyweight installation.
Another approach to development is taken by
<a href="http://www.zope.org/">ZOPE</a> where much of the
development can be performed within any web browser. This does not
provide the rich user experience available from 'thick-client' software.
A middle ground can be reached by using technologies such as Dynamic HTML
and applets within the browser. These technologies are becoming more viable
as browsers are enhanced and bandwidth increases.
</p>
<p>
It is probable that Scintilla can be implemented in a 40-80K applet that will download
over a cable modem or similar in a second or so making it a viable UI element within
browser based development environments.
</p>
<p>
Plugin code, such as extra lexers, can be used to enhance Scintilla. When used within a
managed platform, Scintilla can be allowed to safely download and integrate
these components as needed for handling the different languages that may be used.
</p>
<p>
It is unclear, at least to me, which of these platforms will be most successful
or if another platform will be even more popular. By targeting both managed
platforms as well as the current unmanaged platforms,
code can be assured of running in the future, no matter which platform wins.
This preserves the investment made in Scintilla code as well as code that uses
Scintilla which can then be migrated to another platform more easily.
</p>
<p>
.NET differentiates between several management concepts. Managed code
runs on .NET using the memory management built into .NET.
Verifiable managed code is a subset of managed code that can be verified as
correct and so can be trusted to run without compromising the user's security.
The aim with SinkWorld is to produce verifiable managed code.
</p>
<h3>Portability isn't hard, its just work</h3>
<p>
Scintilla was originally written to run on Win32 and has since been ported to the
GTK+, wxWindows and Qt toolkits. The platform adaptation layer for one platform is
less than 20% of the size of the platform independent code. While there are sometimes
complexities in dealing with the unique aspects of a platform, the bulk of this code is fairly
straightforward, providing a simple library for performing basic graphics and UI operations,
dealing with the platform's version of events and providing an API in the style of the
platform. The platform independent code is more intricate, with complex control paths and
optimisations making it harder to work on.
</p>
<p>
All GUI environments offer similar capabilities. Where they differ, providing only
lowest common denominator functionality can be avoided by building rich
functionality out of lower level functions and by allowing functionality that only
exists on one platform. An example of this in the current version of Scintilla is that
Unicode is only supported on Windows. Once Unicode is well supported on other
platforms then Scintilla can be changed to provide that feature. If a platform
doesn't provide its own Unicode support then it is also possible, although it would be
a significant amount of work, to develop Unicode support within the platform
adaptation layer.
</p>
<h3>Target Languages</h3>
<p>
To target these different platforms, as well as the platforms
currently targeted by Scintilla, different programming languages
must be used. C++ can not be used on the JVM or for verifiable managed code
on .NET as it is an unsafe language, using machine address pointers with no
bounds checking. .NET does allow mixing unsafe and safe code but using
some unsafe code means that the assembly is unsafe.
Managed C++ can be used on .NET but not to produce verifiable managed code.
There is no C# compiler available for the JVM and while a
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualj/jump/default.asp">Java compiler for .NET</a>
has been announced, no details about availability, price, or whether it will remain
supported in the long term have been revealed.
</p>
<p>
Implementing and supporting a version of Scintilla in multiple languages would
take quite a bit of effort. This effort can be minimised if it were possible to
compile for unmanaged platforms, the JVM, and .NET from one code base.
</p>
<p>
The C++, Managed C++, C#, and Java languages are similar enough that
very similar code can be written in each. Here is an implementation of a split
buffer, the core class used to store text in Scintilla, in all four languages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="cbxh.html">C++</a></li>
<li><a href="cbxhpp.html">Managed C++</a></li>
<li><a href="cbxcs.html">C#</a></li>
<li><a href="cbxjava.html">Java</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
A <a href="cbxdiff.html">combined difference view</a> uses background colour to indicate how the 4 files differ.
</p>
<p>
The languages are <i>so</i> similar that it is possible to automatically
translate from one to the other with a small amount of code and this has been
the major focus of initial SinkWorld development.
</p>
<p>
The above module was the first translated by hand from C++, before the start of the
XLang.py translation tool so code differences, such as * versus [] were
minimised. With automatic translation, more idiomatic code can be generated.
</p>
<h3>C~ - a C++ subset translatable to Java and C#</h3>
<p>
It may be possible to translate Java or C# into C++ but C++, especially the preprocessor,
allows a degree of freedom in writing valid source code not available in C# or Java.
The preprocessor allows inserting instructions to the translation program that create
valid C++ code or are empty and so disappear after preprocessing.
This is the reason that the work done so far has been using a subset of C++ as
the primary source representation of components. This freedom has not been needed
so far as the development has encountered fewer problems than expected but this
technique may be needed later.
</p>
<p>
C++ is a very complex language and most developers and projects keep to a subset
of C++. Scintilla has used a subset that does not include exceptions, templates or
run-time type information. As Java and C# use exceptions widely, SinkWorld code
will have to deal with exceptions and so the C++ version of the code will also need
to handle exceptions.
Templates or generics are not yet available for C#/.NET and are not
standardised for Java, so any use of templates will require that the language
translator expand templates.
Templates do not appear necessary although it could, for example, be useful
to parameterise the cbx class shown above by the type of data stored in the
buffer to allow a choice between 8 bit characters and 16 bit characters.
The run-time type information available in Java and .NET is very complete
and useful but is far beyond that provided by C++, so will not be used
in SinkWorld.
</p>
<p class="update">
There is now a simple template expansion program, Template.py which is used
to create 1, 2, and 4 byte wide versions of cbx to be used as styling buffers depending
on the amount of styling information required by an application.
</p>
<p>
The subset of C++ used in SinkWorld does not yet have a formal definition, and is instead
defined by what the tools allow.
The subset will expand over time as more code is converted to be translatable.
Since this subset may need to be discussed, and may be defined formally, it is
called C~, pronounced C-wriggle.
</p>
<p>
Using exceptions in the C++ version does lose some portability to platforms such as WinCE
which do not support exceptions. It may be possible to use the Java or C# translations
for these platforms. WinCE is supposed to support .NET.
</p>
<p>
In some places C++ does not differentiate as much as Java or C#. Java and C# have more
forms of privacy than C++ and differentiate between interfaces and classes.
As C# and Java only allow implementation inheritance from one super class,
the C~ input must also restrict implementation inheritance and differentiate between
classes and interfaces. This will be by a convention where interface names start with 'I'
which is already used by some developers, particularly those using COM.
</p>
<p>
C~ is a subset of C++ rather than a complete new language as it is easier to use other
tools such as debuggers on the code if the primary representation is a current
programming language. Developing a new language would also redirect effort towards
defining and improving the new language rather than working on the classes.
</p>
<h3>XLang - an automatic translator</h3>
<p>
The XLang translator reads and tokenises C++ (C~) source code and then performs
a series of lexical transformations to change C++ syntax into C# and Java syntax.
</p>
<p>
Translation is done line by line so some syntax elements such as method declarations must
currently be on one line to be handled.
The transformations are mostly substitutions of sequences of lexemes into other sequences
of lexemes using a small lexeme sequence description language.
</p>
<p>
Currently, all class methods must be defined within the class definition, so all of a class
is defined in one place. This should be improved in the future with the normal class
header and implementation files merged to construct the Java/C# code.
There is already another translator,
<a href="http://tech.novosoft-us.com/product_c2j.jsp">C2J++</a> which can perform
this merging.
</p>
<p class="update">
Methods may now be defined either in the header or declared in a header and
defined in a source file.
</p>
<p>
The description language consists of a stream of lexeme descriptions separated by "~"
with a literal "~" represented by "~~". Each lexeme description starts with a letter
designating the lexical class and an optional value. An empty value matches any value.
The lexical class letters are listed in CxxTokens.py.
"kprivate~o:" matches the keyword "private" followed by the operator ":".
A very simple translation would change the C++
"NULL" constant identifier to the Java/C# "null" with<br />
<code>tokens.substTokenStrings("iNULL", "null")</code><br />
A more complex translation takes constants defined as enumerations and produces
Java/C# "static int" declarations, so "enum { SCE_C_DEFAULT = 0 };" becomes
"static int SCE_C_DEFAULT = 0;" with<br />
<code>tokens.substTokenStrings("kenum~o{~i~o=~m~o}", "static int $2 = $4", 1)</code><br />
which uses the final "ignore whitespace" argument to handle situations where optional whitespace
may appear between elements. The "$n" substitutions refer to the values that match
each lexeme.
</p>
<p>
By acting on lexemes XLang can avoid some of the context sensitivity problems that
would occur if it used regular expressions to match input. However, this means that
it does not have many of the features of regular expressions such as matching "any number" or
"one or more" elements which would be useful when matching constructs such as a list of
type keywords like "const unsigned long".
</p>
<h3>Current code</h3>
<p>
The current code can be <a href="SinkWorld.zip">downloaded</a>.
It is also available from the sinkworld module in the Scintilla CVS.
This code only works completely on Windows NT and Windows 2000.
Building all the code requires quite a few tools:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/">Microsoft .NET Beta 1</a>,
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java</a>,
JUnit, NUnit, and CppUnit. It should be possible to translate to Java and build that
without .NET installed with "make mj.class". To allow deployment to users without
all these tools in the future there will also be distributions with all the code generation
already performed so someone using the Java translation will only need a Java compiler.
</p>
<p>
Four classes have been implemented:
<ul>
<li>cbx is a split buffer of characters</li>
<li>pbx combines
two split buffers with one storing text and the other the corresponding styling information
(equivalent to the CellBuffer class in Scintilla)</li>
<li>SAccessor acts as intermediary to access the data in a pbx holding a styling cursor
(equivalent to the Accessor interface and its implementations in Scintilla)</li>
<li>LexCPP
implements a C++ lexer which reads text from an SAccessor and writes styles to it</li>
<li class="update">cbx_0, cbx_1, cbx_2, and cbx_4 are split buffers of 0 byte,
1 byte, 2 byte or 4 byte values which may be used as styling buffers.
cbx_1 is used as the text buffer.</li>
<li class="update">undoStack and undoAction implement undo and redo.</li>
<li class="update">giv is an integer vector that uses a gap to avoid copying
like cbx_*.</li>
<li class="update">lv is derived from giv and is used to store the position
of each line in a buffer. It uses a 'step' to avoid many addition operations when
inserting and removing text.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
These classes are implemented in C++ and Managed C++ and the C++ implementations
are automatically converted to C# and Java implementations.
There is also some support code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a library of environment functions for logging,
timing and assertions implemented in each of the four languages</li>
<li>a declaration of a "BadPositionException" class in each language
as XLang doesn't yet know how
to translate exception declarations</li>
<li>a short test application written in each language. The Java and C# versions
do something almost useful by converting a small piece of C code to styled HTML.</li>
<li>a unit test module for
C++ (using an older version of <a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/">CppUnit</a>),
Java (<a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>), and
C# (<a href="http://nunit.sourceforge.net/">NUnit</a>).
The Java and C# unit tests are quite good due to the quality of the underlying
unit test frameworks but the C++ tests are not as robust due to
the relative immaturity of CppUnit and the lack of universal standard for reflection and
dynamic loading in C++.</li>
</ul>
<p class="update">
The Managed C++ version has not been updated with the new classes.
</p>
<p>
The use of unit testing frameworks is very important in this project to ensure that the
automatically translated code has the same behaviour in each translation.
</p>
<h3>Open Questions</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Will this work?</li>
<li>Is a lexical translator strong enough or should a parser and tree transformer
be developed?</li>
<li>Will the translated code be good enough to work with or will it be a difficult
to debug mess like the C code produce by Cfront from C++?</li>
<li>How do you know whether the C++ you write is good C~?</li>
<li>Is this a good use of the languages, or will the translated code perform badly
and suffer from errors such as bad type translations?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="update">
The current code performs well with the slowest translation being around one third of
C++ speed. This code is faster than Scintilla because of better data strucures.
