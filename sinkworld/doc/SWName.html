<h3>Where is SinkWorld?</h3>
<p>
SinkWorld is a land sunk beneath the level of the sea but not submerged.
Waterfalls surrounding pour the sea into SinkWorld yet do not drown it.
Strong currents draw passing ships towards SinkWorld and over the waterfalls.
Not many escape. Some survive but they remain cut off from the events of the 
outside world.

The concept behind the SinkWorld software development plan is
to simplify the issues involved in working on Scintilla by developing pieces 
of functionality in isolation, in a <strong>synch</strong>ronous 
context, where there are no callbacks, threads or GUI interactions.
This should make it easier to work on performance and testing by not needing 
to consider the effects of the containing environment which is where much of the 
complexity in UI components comes from. Once these pieces are well tested
by a unit testing framework and efficient, they can be integrated into larger
components that require more complex interactions.
</p>
<p>
Some features require significant processing time so may be performed
be a series of incremental steps rather than as indivisible actions if no
sufficiently fast technique can be found. This may include such tasks as 
lexical analysis of source code and line wrapping.
This is an intermediate area between the completely isolated and the 
completely integrated and may be worked on as part of SinkWorld.

<p>
I like code to have evocative names and like to use metaphors when
thinking through stuff even if they seem very separated from the problem
domain. Often unexpected associations occur leading to new ideas.

<p>
Sunken lands are a recurring theme in myth - Ys and Atlantis being
well known examples. Often associated with the fall of a land because of the
hubris of the inhabitants.
